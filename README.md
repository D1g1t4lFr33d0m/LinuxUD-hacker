# LinuxUD-hacker
A package designed specifically to supply your operating system with cool hacking applications.

Here are some very useful tools that can be useful when checking the security of networks, systems, websites and more. Certainly, people interested in cybersecurity will find something interesting here for themselves.

Have fun using this Linux update, and be sure to have someone else's permission to test security. :)
